# Homebridge Broadlink RM [TV Fork]

# About this fork
This fork adds support for the TV type indroduced in iOS 12.2. I'm only give support for this specific accessory type! If you want to use this fork, use this command:

`npm i -g git+https://github.com/AlexanderBabel/homebridge-broadlink-rm.git`

# Known issues

If you want to use more than one TV accessory you currently need to setup multiple homebridge instances. This will be fixed in the future. Currently it's the simplest workaround.
